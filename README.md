In this project, my group and I conducted an analysis of public COVID-19 datasets. Most datasets are at the country- or state-level, but we found three that were at the individual-level, which could potentially be an issue with regards to privacy protection.

Our analysis is available in [AC_221_Final_Project.pdf](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/COVID19-Privacy-Analysis/blob/master/AC_221_Final_Project.pdf).

### Usage
